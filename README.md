# Lab06 - TypeScript

## Installation and Setup

### Installing TypeScript
To begin, make sure TypeScript is installed globally on your system. You can check this by running the version command. If it's not installed, use the package manager to install it globally.

### Setting Up the Project
Organizing files properly is crucial for maintaining clean and manageable code. Each exercise should be kept in its respective directory to avoid any conflicts or overwriting issues.

## Exercise Overview

### Exercise 1: Getting Started with TypeScript
This exercise focuses on writing a simple TypeScript file, compiling it, and executing the transpiled JavaScript code. Additionally, modern ES6 features such as template literals and arrow functions are introduced.

### Exercise 2: Working with Classes and Objects
Building upon the basics, this exercise involves defining a class with properties and methods. The objective is to understand object-oriented principles in TypeScript and how to create and use instances of a class.

### Exercise 3: Access Modifiers and Constructors
Here, the focus is on encapsulation by utilizing access modifiers. The constructor method is implemented to initialize object properties, reinforcing the concept of controlled access to class attributes.

### Exercise 4: Modules and Imports
This exercise introduces modularization in TypeScript. By exporting and importing modules, the goal is to learn how to structure code effectively for better reusability and maintainability.

## Submission Guidelines
- Capture appropriate screenshots of the outputs and compile them into a document.
- Ensure all project files are properly structured before zipping the folder.
- Provide a GitHub repository link for the completed work.

By following these steps, the lab exercises should be completed efficiently while reinforcing TypeScript fundamentals.
